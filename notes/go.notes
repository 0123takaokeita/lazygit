    DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------------

https://golang.org/doc/code.html

if you don't have your GOPATH exported, do so with
export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)

you have a GOPATH which points to e.g. ~/go/
this is where everything in go is stored.

it has three directories,
 - src
 - pkg
 - bin

installed programs have their executables stored in bin
all your project and the src code of other people's projects are in src, with paths identifying them e.g.
src/github.com/jesseduffield/gitgot

If you want to make an executable, give every file in your project directory `package main`, otherwise if you want to make a package, name everything `package mypackage`. This name should be the name of the project directory for your project.

to install a program, inside the project folder
go install

This adds the program to /bin

to build a package, inside the project folder
go build

this adds the package to /pkg so that it can be linked easily in the future.

to build and run your program just do this:

~/github.com/jesseduffield/gitgot:
â–¶ go install && gitgot

    BUILD SYSTEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------

Currently for installs I'm using
/Users/jesseduffieldduffield/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/custom_go_install.sublime-build

note that the argument to go install should be the directory from the end of /src/ onwards.
